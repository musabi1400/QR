# QR

A smart QR code generator that leverages the Gemini assistant to intelligently design QR codes based on website content and suggest relevant information.

## Web interface

Open `index.html` in your browser to create customized QR codes. Adjust colors, dot style, or add a center image, then download the result as PNG or SVG.

This front-end uses the [qr-code-styling](https://github.com/kozakdenys/qr-code-styling) library.
